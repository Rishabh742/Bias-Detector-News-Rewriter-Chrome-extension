A Chrome extension is a small software program that customizes the browsing experience. It consists of a manifest file, content scripts, background 
scripts, and a user interface (popup and options pages).

For our bias detector, the manifest.json file defines permissions, scripts, and settings. Content scripts interact with web pages, while background 
scripts handle processing.
